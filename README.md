You must first download the zip from GitHub and unzip it to open it. 
Once executed, the program will process and filter the data from an input CSV file, 
which will be entered in an input folder, then will create output files as well as 
graphics which will be stored in the output folder. To do this, the program uses the 
pandas libraries for DataFrames and to import CSV files and matplotlib to create 
the graphics. To change CSV, you must change the name of the CSV on line 16 of the program.
